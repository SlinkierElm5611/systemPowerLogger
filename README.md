# systemPowerLogger
This is intended as a learning project which will track system power usage using python 3.5 or greater.
As of right now it only works on macOS however has not been tested on any versions earlier thant macOS 11.2 (you may get string errors as the powermetrics cli command may have slight output changes over time)
The Windows and Linux versions are in progress.
